Cross the lines, you don’t know who’s lookin’.
Up ahead, another who’s bookin’.

Want to hear myself, wanna be there
Wanna stay but I don’t want to leave it
Want to hold head up, don’t want to stay down.
I want to live my life,

But you won’t allow.
Stalker wanna be like “I don’t want to hear that.”

I want to be myself, want to be there.
You want to rip my style, and want to be there 
You want to hear my love, want to be there.
You want to steal my life.

I want you to stop trying
To get in the door
That you step through.

I want to be myself.
Don't let him find us, don’t want that life.
Think straight.  Get by.
Gotta think straight to get by.
Think straight.  Get by.

Want to be myself, you wanna be my
Want to be myself, you wanna be my
Want to be myself, you wanna be my

I want to be myself.

(stay out of my life…)
